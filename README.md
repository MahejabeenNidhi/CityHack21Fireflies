### This repository contains files that belong to our team's submission to the CityHack 2021 competition.

### Our submission, Project CoVicheck uses ____ data to ___ and display ______.

### Project CoVicheck focusses on solving issues related to Vaccine Distribution, such as the first few ones mentioned in the next section.
### The next step of Project CoVicheck includes solving the last two problems in the following section, making use of Blockchain and smart contracts.
## Problems to Solve
- Ensure the supply of vaccines to regions that require it the most.
- Solve supply & logistics issues with regards to vaccine distribution and storage.
- Tackle disparities faced in terms of race, status, ethinicity etc. 
- Assist stakeholders in managing the process.
- Ensure trust and complete transparency among all stakeholders.

## Data Sources
- [Centre for Health Protection, Hong Kong](https://www.chp.gov.hk/)
- 

## Goals and the Next Step
- Present information required for efficient and effective distribution of vaccinations in a centralized Dashboard.
- The CoVicheck Dashboard displays _______________.
- Since the CoVicheck Dashboard uses daily data to support its distribution scheme, the vaccination is dispatched to the right people at the right time.
- Create and Deploy Smart Contracts for controlling the distrbution of Vaccine to make sure that vaccines are not reselled and paid at the moment patient receives it.
- Every aspect of supply chain can be replaced by the smart contract, making the entire system more efficient. Decentralized Apps that use Smart Contracts.
- The mobile Applications will be created with the use of blockchain and Smart Contracts. Patiens will need to sign of upon receiving the vaccine by using its ID. Vaccinators will sign off with their ID when vaccinating the Patient.
- In total there are 4 stakeholders in the distrbution of vaccines: Manufactures => Goverment => Vaccinators => Patients.
- The language used in developing Smart Contract is Soloidity and web3.js, which is Ethereum JavaScript API for better interaction with remote nodes. The Smart Contracts will be deployed on Main Ethereum Network.
